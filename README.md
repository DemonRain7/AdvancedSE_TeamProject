## Features

### Data Models

- **Store**: Represents retail stores with unique IDs and names
- **Item**: Products available for purchase with name, price, store association, and category
- **Coupons**: Three types of discount coupons:
  - **TotalPriceCoupon**: Discount when cart total exceeds a threshold
  - **CategoryCoupon**: Discount on specific category items
  - **ItemCoupon**: Discount on a specific item

### Core Functionalities

1. **Optimal Coupon Selection**: Given a cart of items and store, identifies the coupon that provides maximum discount
2. **Store Recommendations**: Given an item keyword or category, returns optimal stores sorted by best price (including applicable coupons)
3. **Cart Optimization**: Given a cart and a TotalPriceCoupon, suggests cheapest items to add to meet the coupon threshold

### Additional Features

- Full CRUD operations for stores, items, and coupons
- Search items by keyword or category
- Filter items and coupons by store
- In-memory data storage for easy testing

## System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

- **Controller Layer** (`RouteController`): REST API endpoints
- **Service Layer** (`CouponService`, `DataService`): Business logic
- **Model Layer**: Data entities (Item, Store, Coupon types)

All components are loosely coupled using dependency injection via Spring Boot.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.4.4
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito
- **Code Coverage**: JaCoCo
- **Style Checker**: CheckStyle (Google Style)
- **Static Analysis**: PMD
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

- Git (for version control)

## Building the Project

### Using Maven Wrapper (Recommended)

**Note**: If you encounter a "Permission denied" error on Unix/macOS, you may need to make the Maven wrapper executable first:
```bash
cd CouponSystem
chmod +x mvnw
```

On Unix/macOS:
```bash
cd CouponSystem
./mvnw clean install
```

On Windows:
```cmd
cd CouponSystem
mvnw.cmd clean install
```

### Using System Maven

```bash
cd CouponSystem
mvn clean install
```

This will compile the code, run all tests, generate test coverage reports, and perform style checking and static analysis.

## Running the Application

**Note**: If you get a "Permission denied" error, see the [Building the Project](#building-the-project) section for instructions on making `mvnw` executable.

## Third-Party Dependencies

All third-party dependencies are managed via Maven and specified in `pom.xml`. Key dependencies include:

- **Spring Boot Starter Web** (org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:3.4.4)
  - Source: Maven Central
  - Purpose: Web application framework and REST API support
  
- **Spring Boot Starter Test** (org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test:3.4.4)
  - Source: Maven Central
  - Purpose: Testing framework including JUnit 5 and Mockito

- **JaCoCo Maven Plugin** (org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.11)
  - Source: Maven Central
  - Purpose: Code coverage reporting

- **Maven Checkstyle Plugin** (org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.0)

  - Purpose: Code style checking (Google Java Style)

- **Maven PMD Plugin** (org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-pmd-plugin:3.21.2)
  - Source: Maven Central
  - Purpose: Static code analysis

No third-party code is directly included in the repository. All dependencies are fetched automatically by Maven during the build process.

## Important Notes

### Coupon Usage Rules

1. **No Stacking**: Only one coupon can be applied to a cart at a time
2. **Store-Specific**: Coupons only apply to items from their designated store
3. **Discount Limits**: Fixed-amount discounts never exceed the applicable subtotal

### API Call Order

- **Stores must be created before items**: Items require a valid `storeId`
- **Items must exist before creating item-specific coupons**: ItemCoupon requires a valid `targetItemId`
- **Core functionality endpoints require existing data**: Ensure stores, items, and coupons are created first

### Data Persistence

- Data is stored **in-memory only**
- All data is lost when the application restarts
- Suitable for development and testing; production use would require a database

## API Testing

We test our API by starting the service and running individual API calls through Postman. The testing approach is manual and comprehensive, covering all endpoints with valid, atypical, and invalid inputs.

### Automated Testing Script

For convenience, we provide a comprehensive automated test script that runs all tests using curl:

```bash
# Start the application first
cd CouponSystem
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# In another terminal, run the automated test suite
./test-api.sh
```

The `test-api.sh` script will:
- Run all 75+ test cases covering all 20 API endpoints
- Test with typical valid, atypical valid, and invalid inputs
- Verify WRITE/READ persistent data operations
- Test multi-client functionality
- Display color-coded PASS/FAIL results
- Provide a comprehensive summary of test coverage

If not using the automated script, you can also run individual API calls manually using Postman or curl commands (see test cases below).

### Testing Methodology

#### Prerequisites

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   cd CouponSystem
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Wait for the startup message: `Started CouponSystemApplication in X seconds`

3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

4. Use Postman or curl to make API calls

#### Logging Verification

Spring Boot automatically logs all HTTP requests to the console. To verify logging:
- Monitor the console output where the application is running
- Each API call will generate log entries showing the HTTP method, endpoint, and response status
- Look for lines like: `INFO ... Mapped GET "/stores" ...`

### Comprehensive Test Suite

The following test suite covers all API endpoints with at least three test cases each (typical valid, atypical valid, and invalid inputs). Tests also verify persistent data storage/retrieval and multi-client functionality.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Client1Store"}'
# Expected: {"id":4,"name":"Client1Store"}

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/item \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Client1Item", "price": 25.00, "storeId": 4, "category": "electronics"}'
# Expected: {"id":5,"name":"Client1Item",...}

# Client 2: Create store and items
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/store \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Client2Store"}'
# Expected: {"id":5,"name":"Client2Store"}

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/item \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Client2Item", "price": 30.00, "storeId": 5, "category": "electronics"}'
# Expected: {"id":6,"name":"Client2Item",...}
```

# Expected: Array containing only Client1Item, not Client2Item
# Verifies multi-client data isolation
```

Test 6.2 - Multi-client: Verify Client 2 data isolation
```bash
# Test that Client 2 can only see their own items (READ operation)
curl http://localhost:8080/items/store/5
# Expected: Array containing only Client2Item, not Client1Item
# Verifies multi-client data isolation
```

Test 6.3 - Multi-client: Concurrent coupon creation
```bash
# Client 1 creates coupon
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/coupon \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "totalprice", "storeId": 4, "discountValue": 5.0, "isPercentage": false, "minimumPurchase": 20.0}'
# Expected: Coupon for Client 1 with 201 CREATED

# Client 2 creates coupon
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/coupon \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "totalprice", "storeId": 5, "discountValue": 10.0, "isPercentage": true, "minimumPurchase": 25.0}'
# Expected: Coupon for Client 2 with 201 CREATED
# Verifies both clients can create coupons independently
```

Test 6.4 - Multi-client: Verify coupon isolation
```bash
# Verify Client 1's coupons
curl http://localhost:8080/coupons/store/4
# Expected: Array with only Client 1's coupon

# Verify Client 2's coupons
curl http://localhost:8080/coupons/store/5
# Expected: Array with only Client 2's coupon
# Verifies coupon data isolation between clients
```

Test 6.5 - Multi-client: Cross-client cart operation (should not work)
```bash
# Test Client 1 trying to use items from Client 2's store
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/cart/optimal-coupon \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"itemIds": [6], "storeId": 4}'
# Expected: Error or "No applicable coupon found."
# Verifies clients cannot interfere with each other
```

Test 6.6 - Multi-client: Independent store operations
```bash
# Client 1 deletes their item
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/item/5
# Expected: "Item deleted successfully."

# Verify Client 2's items are unaffected
curl http://localhost:8080/items/store/5
# Expected: Array still containing Client2Item
# Verifies one client's operations don't affect another
```

### Test Execution Notes

1. **Test Order**: Tests should be executed in the order presented, as later tests depend on data created by earlier tests

2. **Logging Verification**: After running all tests, check the application console logs to verify:
   - All endpoints were called and logged
   - HTTP status codes match expected values
   - No unexpected errors occurred

3. **Persistence Verification**: The WRITE/READ test pairs (e.g., Tests 2.1/2.4, 3.1/3.4, 4.1/4.7) verify that:
   - Data written via POST requests is persisted
   - Data can be retrieved via GET requests
   - The retrieved data matches what was written

4. **Multi-Client Verification**: Tests 6.1-6.6 verify that:
   - Multiple clients can use the service simultaneously
   - Each client's data is isolated (one client can't access another's data)
   - Operations on one client's data don't affect another client's data

5. **Coverage Summary**:
   - Total endpoints: 20
   - Total tests: 75+ (average 3-4 per endpoint)
   - Typical valid inputs: 20+ tests
   - Atypical valid inputs: 20+ tests
   - Invalid inputs: 20+ tests
   - Write operations: 15+ tests
   - Read operations: 30+ tests
   - Multi-client tests: 6 tests

### Expected Results

All tests should complete with their expected HTTP status codes and response bodies. The console logs should show all API calls being logged with appropriate status codes. The multi-client tests should demonstrate complete data isolation between different stores/clients.
